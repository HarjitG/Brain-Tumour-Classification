# Brain-Tumour-Classification
Using Convolutional neural networks to identify the type of brain tumor based off the images

In this dataset we have 4 different classes, 3 of which are different types of Tumors, and one of which is not a Tumor

I have taken 3 different approaches to this project. The first was runing a model on all 4 classes but due to the number of Tumors being classes as non-tumors, I am experimenting with a model with 2 parts:
1) Classsifing Tumor vs Non Tumor
2) Classifying the 3 differnet types of Tumors

Colab_Notebook_4d Contains all 4 classes

Colab_Notebook_3d contains the 3 classes of different tumors

Colab_Notebook_Binary contains the 4 classes merged into 2 to give us Tumor vs Non Tumor
